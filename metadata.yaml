description: '"Of the contents of this little volume the section on Mind and Motion
  which forms, in accordance with a suggestion of the author''s, a general introduction,
  was delivered at Cambridge as the Rede Lecture in 1885, and was printed in the Contemporary
  Review for June in that year. The chapter on The World as an Eject was published,
  almost as it now stands, in the Contemporary Review for July, 1886. A paper on The
  Fallacy of Materialism, of which Mr. Romanes incorporated the more important parts
  in the Essay on Monism, was contributed to the Nineteenth Century for December,
  1882. The rest was left in MS. and was probably written in 1889 or 1890"--Preface.
